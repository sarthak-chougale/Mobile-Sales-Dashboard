This project presents the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze business performance with a focus on Total Quantity as the primary metric. 
Originally inspired by a sales analysis tutorial, the project has been modified from the “Total Sales” perspective to emphasize “Total Quantity,” enabling a deeper understanding of product demand trends.
The solution integrates Power Query for data transformation, DAX for advanced calculations, and a variety of Power BI visuals to provide actionable insights. 
The dataset, structured in Excel/CSV format, includes dimensions such as product, category, region, and date, with the “Quantity” column serving as the central measure for analysis.
From a business standpoint, the dashboard addresses the common challenge of identifying where and when demand is strongest.
It allows decision-makers to monitor trends in product quantities sold across different time periods, categories, and regions. 
The goal is not only to track quantity movement but also to support inventory planning, supply chain optimization, and targeted marketing strategies. 
The dashboard includes several key visuals: KPI cards highlight overall quantity sold; time-series charts capture monthly and yearly fluctuations; bar and column charts enable comparisons across regions and categories; slicers provide interactivity for filtering by time, product, or geography; and distribution charts display category-wise contributions.
Together, these visuals offer a comprehensive view of demand patterns. The insights generated from this analysis have significant business implications.
Organizations can identify underperforming products or regions, detect seasonality in demand, and make data-driven decisions to improve forecasting accuracy.
Furthermore, aligning inventory with demand reduces operational inefficiencies, while recognizing high-performing segments supports strategic growth. 
In essence, the dashboard transforms raw quantity data into a decision-support system that empowers managers with clarity and foresight.
This project has been uploaded to GitHub under the repository Mobile-Sales-Dashboard to ensure version control, showcase analytical capabilities, and make the solution accessible for collaboration and learning within the data analysis community. 
By leveraging Power BI’s robust features, the project demonstrates how structured data and advanced visualization techniques can be applied to uncover meaningful insights and drive measurable business impact.
